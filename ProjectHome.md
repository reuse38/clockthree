We propose to manufacture an open source Arduino-based RGB LED array we've called "ClockTHREE." The initial application is for a multi-color word clock (like QlockTWO, available for $1200 from http://www.qlocktwo.com/), but since the 192 (16x10 + 16x2) LEDs are individually addressable and programmable, this device will support several languages as well as any number of other applications. ClockTHREE is an awesome platform for anyone to explore time and color. Other applications in the works: a sun clock that displays where on the globe the sun is currently shining a la Qlock and a thermometer that tells the temperature with words and color. ClockTHREE can also be used for scrolling text, and maybe even low res color tv!
